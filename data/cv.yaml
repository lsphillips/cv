      Led six cross-functional teams delivering products across three technical platforms in the UK, Canada, and the Netherlands; collectively these teams are responsible for partner data, availability, reachability, verification (KYC & KYB), onboarding and various support tooling.

      I acted as a cross-domain technical leader, collaborating with engineering and product to design and deliver cross-domain features to the platform. This regularly involved authoring and presenting design documents and ADRs to stakeholders and engineering hubs to drive alignment and decision-making. I partnered closely with engineering managers, principal engineers and product owners to shape technical plans and roadmaps, playing a pivotal role in a high-priority platform consolidation initiative.

      I mentored senior and mid-level engineers, guiding solution design in line with company best practices, such as Goldilocks service design and the use of ECST. I delivered multiple proof-of-concepts to address emerging challenges facing my teams, such as enabling Salesforce to consume platform events via Redpanda Connect and proposing a mono-repo strategy to consolidate a growing number of nano-services into more manageable Goldilocks services. I would often evangelize these ideas further beyond my immediate domain, working with guilds (some of which I chaired) and architecture hubs to convert proofs-of-concept into company-wide guidance and documentation, accelerating delivery across the organization.
